Simple Network Zui Chat Example:

- Red nodes are for system host targets
- Teal nodes are for system and html browser client targets

** Both host nodes and client nodes are allowed on the same node tree however browser html targets are not capable of being hosts and will be ignored when exporting

** If you plan on using 3rd party server / client configuration please keep in mind our nodes use bytes and buffers even for regular strings

** Once a buffer is read it is not accessible any more, meaning if a msg parser node matches the same API field the buffer will be read and converted back into its data type
