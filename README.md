When adding a new project:

- Demonstrate a single feature
- Keep your assets as small as possible
- Save the project into a directory with the same name as the main blend file (`<project>/<project>.blend`)
- Prefix the name of the project with the category the of the showcase (`logic_`, `light_`, `render_`, `ui_`, ...)
- Add a `<project>/README.md` describing the project
- If the `README.md` includes usage instructions (like: keybindings) link it as text file into blenders __Text Editor__.
- Remove any orphaned data from your blend file
